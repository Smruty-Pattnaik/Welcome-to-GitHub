Git is a Distributed Version Control System(DVCS).
It handles all the things like merging of different source code from different people 
and maintaining the versions.

If we are working in a company,all the codes are stored in a server.
So if incase server fails then all the codes will be deleted.
To improve this,we can have our own copy/local repository
  which in present in the remote repository.So if the server fails,
  we will not loose the codes and can use them in need and later upload it in the server.
  This is called DVCS-local repository is distributed amonmg the developers.
  
  GitHub is web based interface which uses Git.
  
  Thank You.
